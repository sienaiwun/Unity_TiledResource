# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.7.2] - 2019-03-09
- Fixed gles2 build error.
- Fixed post-processing blit shader error in gles2.

## [5.7.1] - 2019-03-08
### Fixed
- Fixed a project import issue in the LWRP template.

## [5.7.0] - 2019-03-07
### Added
- Added support for overriding terrain detail rendering shaders, via the render pipeline editor resources asset
- You can now create a custom forward renderer by clicking on `Assets/Create/Rendering/Lightweight Render Pipeline/Forward Renderer`. This creates an Asset in your Project. You can add additional features to it and drag-n-drop the renderer to either the pipeline Asset or to a camera.
- You can now add `ScriptableRendererFeature`  to the `ScriptableRenderer` to extend it with custom effects. A feature is an `ScriptableObject` that can be drag-n-dropped in the renderer and adds one or more `ScriptableRenderPass` to the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderer` now exposes interface to configure lights. To do so, implement `SetupLights` when you create a new renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderer` now exposes interface to configure culling. To do so, implement `SetupCullingParameters` when you create a new renderer.
- `ScriptableRendererData` contains rendering resources for `ScriptableRenderer`. A renderer can be overridden globally for all cameras or on a per-camera basis.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now has a `RenderPassEvents`. This controls where in the pipeline the render pass is added.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `ConfigureTarget` and `ConfigureClear`. This allows the renderer to automatically figure out the currently active rendering targets.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `Blit`. This performs a blit and sets the active render target in the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `RenderPostProcessing`. This renders post-processing and sets the active render target in the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `CreateDrawingSettings` as a helper for render passes that need to call `ScriptableRenderContext.DrawRenderers`.

### Changed
- Removed `RegisterShaderPassName` from `ScriptableRenderPass`. Instead, `CreateDrawingSettings` now  takes one or a list of `ShaderTagId`. 
- Removed remaining experimental namespace from LWRP. All APIrelated to `ScriptableRenderer`, `ScriptableRenderPass`, and render pass injection is now out of preview.
- Removed `SetRenderTarget` from `ScriptableRenderPass`. You should never call it. Instead, call `ConfigureTarget`, and the renderer automatically sets up targets for you. 
- Removed `RenderFullscreenQuad` from `ScriptableRenderer`. Use `CommandBuffer.DrawMesh` and `RenderingUtils.fullscreenMesh` instead.
- Removed `RenderPostProcess` from `ScriptableRenderer`. Use `ScriptableRenderPass.RenderPostProcessing` instead.
- Removed `postProcessingContext` property from `ScriptableRenderer`. This is now exposed in `RenderingUtils.postProcessingContext`.
- Removed `GetCameraClearFlag` from `ScriptableRenderer`.

### Fixed
- Terrain detail rendering now works correctly when LWRP is installed but inactive.
- Fixed y-flip in VR when post-processing is active.
- Fixed occlusion mesh for VR not rendering before rendering opaques.
- Enabling or disabling SRP Batcher in runtime works now.
- Fixed video player recorder when post-processing is enabled.

## [5.6.0] - 2019-02-21

## [5.5.0] - 2019-02-18
### Changed
- Code refactor: all macros with ARGS have been swapped with macros with PARAM. This is because the ARGS macros were incorrectly named.

## [5.4.0] - 2019-02-11
### Fixed
- Fixed the SRP Batcher, so it now works with MacOS and iOS.

## [5.3.1] - 2019-01-28

### Fixed
- Fixed Per-object reflection probes.

## [5.3.0] - 2019-01-28
### Added
- LWRP now uses the Unity recorder extension. You can use this to capture the output of Cameras.
- You can now inject a custom render pass before LWRP renders opaque objects. To do so, implement an `IBeforeRender` interface.
- Baked Lit Shader, which uses global illumination via Light Probes and lightmaps, but no real-time lighting. 
- Distortion support in all Particle Shaders.
- An upgrade system for LWRP Materials with `MaterialPostprocessor`.
- An upgrade path for Unlit shaders
- Tooltips for Shaders.
- SRP Batcher support for Particle Shaders.
- Docs for these Shaders: Baked Lit, Particles Lit, Particles Simple Lit, and Particles Unlit.
- LWRP now supports dynamic resolution scaling. The target platform must also support it.
- LWRP now includes version defines for both C# and Shaders in the format of `LWRP_X_Y_Z_OR_NEWER`. For example, `LWRP_5_3_0_OR_NEWER` defines version 5.3.0.
- The Terrain Lit Shader now samples Spherical Harmonics if you haven't baked any lightmaps for terrain.
- Added a __Priority__ option, which you can use to tweak the rendering order. This is similar to render queue in the built-in render pipeline. These Shaders now have this option: Lit, Simple Lit, Baked Lit, Unlit, and all three Particle Shaders.

### Changed
- You can now only initialize a camera by setting a Background Type. The supported options are Skybox, Solid Color, and Don't Care.
- LWRP now uses non-square shadowmap textures when it renders directional shadows with 2 shadow cascades. 
- LWRP now uses RGB111110 as the HDR format on mobile devices, when this format is supported.
- Removed `IAfterDepthPrePass` interface.
- Weâ€™ve redesigned the Shader GUI. For example, all property names in Shaders are now inline across the board
- The Simple Lit Shader now has Smoothness, which can be stored in the alpha of specular or albedo maps.
- The Simple Lit and Particles Simple Lit Shaders now take shininess from the length (brightness) of the specular map.
- The __Double sided__ property is now __Render Face__. This means you can also do front face culling.
- Changed the docs for Lit Shader, Simple Lit Shader and Unlit Shader according to Shader GUI changes.
- When you create a new LWRP Asset, it will now be initialized with settings that favor performance on mobile platforms.
- Updated the [FAQ](faq.md) and the [Built-in/LWRP feature comparison table](lwrp-builtin-feature-comparison.md).

## [2.0.0-preview]

### Added
- Explicit render target load/store actions were added to improve tile utilization
- Camera opaque color can be requested on the pipeline asset. It can be accessed in the shader by defining a _CameraOpaqueTexture. This can be used as an alternative to GrabPass.
- Dynamic Batching can be enabled in the pipeline asset
- Pipeline now strips unused or invalid variants and passes based on selected pipeline capabilities in the asset. This reduces build and memory consuption on target.
- Shader stripping settings were added to pipeline asset

### Changed
#### Pipeline
- Pipeline code is now more modular and extensible. A ForwardRenderer class is initialized by the pipeline with RenderingData and it's responsible for enqueueing and executing passes. In the future pluggable renderers will be supported.
- On mobile 1 directional light + up to 4 local lights (point or spot) are computed
- On other platforms 1 directional light + up to 8 local lights are computed
- Multiple shadow casting lights are supported. Currently only 1 directional + 4 spots light shadows.
#### Shading Framework
- Directional Lights are always considered a main light in shader. They have a fast shading path with no branching and no indexing.
- GetMainLight() is provided in shader to initialize Light struct with main light shading data. 
- Directional lights have a dedicated shadowmap for performance reasons. Shadow coord always comes from interpolator.
- MainLigthRealtimeShadowAttenuation(float4 shadowCoord) is provided to compute main light realtime shadows.
- Spot and Point lights are always shaded in the light loop. Branching on uniform and indexing happens when shading them.
- GetLight(half index, float3 positionWS) is provided in shader to initialize Light struct for spot and point lights.
- Spot light shadows are baked into a single shadow atlas.
- Shadow coord for spot lights is always computed on fragment.
- Use LocalLightShadowAttenuation(int lightIndex, float3 positionWS) to comppute realtime shadows for spot lights.
